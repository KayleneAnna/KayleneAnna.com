As you've probably figured out by now, my name is Kaylene! I'm a marketing and communication professional with experience in a handful of industries and an insatiable curiosity.

My career in the communication and marketing world started during my entry into the journalism program at Carleton University. After discovering that the program wasn't the best fit for me, and after some helpful discussions with my TA, I realized that I could take my strong interpersonal skills and desire to help other people reach their goals into the more general communications world. During my last year at Carleton, I decided
to dip my toes into the marketing and public relations world by taking a few courses to learn more. After four years, I graduated from Carleton with a Bachelor of Arts Honuors Degree in Communication Studies and a much better understanding of how to create content that would be both effective and professional, plus a lot of knowledge about the theory of communication. 

A year after completing my degree, I realized that the job field wasn't what I was expecting and knew I wanted to learn more so I could better myself as a professional. This led me to enroll in the public relations diploma program at Algonquin College after talking to a friend who had just completed the program. My two years at Algonquin truly helped me hone my communication, marketing, and public relations skills and showed me that this is truly the field I not only enjoy but excel in. During this time I learned how to better use Adobe programs like InDesign and Photoshop, how to create a sponsorship package for not only an event but also an entire charity campaign. My time management and organizational skills were also put to the test with a constant stream of varying project sizes, social life, and a part-time job. One of the most useful skills that I learned from the program was a soft skill; the ability to effectively work with a wide variety of personality types, which has helped me immensely in my past positions.

Professionally, my experience ranges from volunteering my time to help a music promotion company, to working on a festival marketing campaign during 2017, to working for an optometric organization and being the communication and marketing person for six clinics. These positions have allowed me to create a multitude of products, both digital and print. At Ottawa Festivals, we produced GetFestive brochures, of which, 100,000 were handed out, promotional YouTube videos, graphics for social and cross-promotional events with festivals, and local businesses. My time at Sustainable Development Technology Canada allowed me to work on content for the intranet as well as the organization’s WordPress website and all the social media platforms that were used. 

eyeDOCS allowed me to further my experience with planning both internal and external events, including employee appreciation events and running a company booth and Run For The Cure. At this position, I was able to use my communication skills to help create and edit strategic documents and aid in the planning for future marketing and communication projects. My skills with WordPress, HTML, and accessibility training were put to the test and expanded, thanks to the work I did on the company’s website as well as the planning for potential future updates on the site. 

All of these positions allowed me to work on my ability to create content that can reach a variety of audiences while still being approachable and interesting. I’ve learned how to use Google Analytics to understand not only what messaging works but where outreach might be lacking and how an organization might be able to strengthen their communication and marketing efforts. Throughout my time, I’ve also used tools like Mailchimp and Canva to help create graphics and reach audiences through email marketing campaigns. 

In saying all this, I believe what sets me apart from other professionals at my level is my insatiable curiosity and desire to always be improving myself and my skills. Areas and skillsets where I may be lacking are less of a challenge and more of an opportunity for me to grow, not only as a person, but also as a professional.
