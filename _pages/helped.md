### Projects/Events at eyeDOCS

- Organized and promoted the eyeDOCS' team, and ran a booth at Run For The Cure. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EyeDocsOttawa/photos/a.529457210432768/2764564676921999/?type=3&theater">team</a> raised over $3,000 and it was a great team bonding day!
- Helped revitalize the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eyedocsottawa/">eyeDOCS Instagram account</a> by creating a more cohesive page and including more merchandising posts. 

### Projects/Events at SDTC

- Helped coordinate and do run-of-show for the Third Annual Cleantech Summit. A report of the entire event and its outcomes can be found <a href="https://sdtc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2018SDTCCleantechLeadershipSummitReport_July17-1.pdf">here</a>.
	* Videos were produced from the Summit, which I helped coordinate and worked behind the camera as the interviewer for the cleantech thought leaders. The videos can be found below:

### Projects/Events at Ottawa Festivals
- Played an integral role in many aspects of the #GetFestive campaign that was launched during 2017 and is still being used today.
	* The #GetFestive campaign saw a refresh of the Ottawa Festivals brochure. The <a href="/assets/portfolio/getfestive-brochure.pdf">#GetFestive edition</a> saw the inclusion of a map of Ottawa and indications of where each festival took place. All festival information was collected and organized by myself and I worked with my manager and a third-party for the layout and graphic elements.
	* Festival Friday videos were put together to help further promote Ottawa Festival member events. We worked with a third-party vendor for the video filming and editing but the images used and scripts were done by myself and students/interns that I managed.

	* During the 2017 edition of #GetFestive, I was also responsible for interviewing, hiring and managing a team of student ambassadors.

	* The student ambassadors and myself were part of many local <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BW3DHTUjKx0/">events</a> put on by MPs.
	* A #GetFestive presence was also visible at other events, including the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb4mEC-nCx9/">2017 Grey Cup Festival</a>. These partnerships allowed us to provide opportunities for festival members to promote themselves to wider audiences.
