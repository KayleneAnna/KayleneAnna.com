<h3> Professional moment I'm most proud of </h3>
Working at Ottawa Festivals during 2017 and helping create and grow the #GetFestive campaign is something I will never forget and always cherish!

<h3> Personal moment I'm most proud of </h3>
Completing three Tough Mudders, which is something I don't normally tell people but looking back, it's absolutely something I should and am proud of. The courses definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone but showed me what I'm capable of on my own and working with others.
